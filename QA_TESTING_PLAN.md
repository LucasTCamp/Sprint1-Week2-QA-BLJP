# Fish game
## Day 1 (Tue): Game mechanics & happy path (does it work as intended?)
We are going to follow the instructions provided to us by the fish game devs to run the game. Then, assuming we were able to run it without issues, we will play the game testing all the game mechanics 
that were stated in their ReadME on how to play. We are just going to do normal gameplay and see if there are any bugs.
## Day 2 (Wed): Input validation & edge cases (what breaks it?)
We will now attack specific points of the game where there could be issues. This involves testing how many rounds there are, how many fish we can put on the hook, etc.
## Day 3 (Thu): Complex scenarios & state management (weird sequences?)
Today is about testing combinations of moves and long gameplay. One of us will play through the game for as long as they can remain sane and try to find issues in the long run. This involves maybe the fish bug out or the rounds stop counting. 
## Day 4 (Fri): Final pass & summary (did we miss anything?)
Consolidate findings and 1 more run through to make sure we didnt miss anything all together. When everyone is satisfied we hand it off.

We will now attack specific points of the game where there could be issues.

## Day 2 (Wed): Input validation & edge cases (what breaks it?)
We will now attack specific points of the game where there could be issues. They made a puzzle type game so we will just try a range of correct/incorrect inputs to see if their are any bugs. Like if we put an incorrect answer and we still get it right would be an issue.
